# Trivia quiz webapp
A simple, lightweight quiz web app built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Questions are fetched from the Open Trivia Database API, shuffled, and presented one at a time. At the end of the quiz, the user is shown their final score and a summary of their results.

The project was developed using VS Code and tested with the Live Server extension for local development.
